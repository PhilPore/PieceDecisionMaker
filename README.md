# PieceDecisionMaker
So, this was something I added more layers onto. Initially this was for a HackerRank problem called "Queen's Attack II". I ended up adding a little flare to it by having the queen decide what the best option would be. Granted, I am still working on it, but most of the logic is done, and needs to be put together/tested.
